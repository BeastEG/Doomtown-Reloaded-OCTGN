Changelog - Doomtown:Reloaded OCTGN Game Definition
===============================================

### 1.0.0.x

Doomtown:Reloaded is now available on OCTGN!

Almost all cards are scripted, and a lot of mechanical effects are automated as well (look for a future how-to-play guide)

## Script Information

* **All Jobs:** Will help at organizing posses, but no effects scripted for success for now. Please take care of it manually
* **All Spells:** They will pull, but don't check for success and don't trigger the result. Please deal with it manually for now.
* **Location Based Abilities:** Location is not tracked, and thus anything that relies on being in a location, or controlling that location will not rules enforce. Just check those conditions manually before using those abilities (e.g. Allie Hensman, Bunkhouse or Extortion)
* 1st Baptist Church: Will take your intreased handsize into account at refill at Sundown, if you control that location
* Ambush: Won't give the extra bounty for targeting a non-wanted char.
